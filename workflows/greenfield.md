# 🌱 Greenfield Project Workflow

Starting a new project from scratch with vibe coding.

---

## Phase 1: Project Vision

### Define the What

```
I want to build [PROJECT NAME].

The problem it solves: [pain point]
Target users: [who]
Core value proposition: [why they'd use it]

Key features (MVP):
1. [Feature 1]
2. [Feature 2]
3. [Feature 3]

Success looks like: [measurable outcome]
```

### Get Stack Recommendations

```
Recommend a tech stack for my project:

Type: [web app / mobile / CLI / API / etc.]
Scale: [MVP / startup / enterprise]
Team: [solo / small team / large team]
Constraints: [budget, time, existing skills]

Priorities:
- [Speed of development / Performance / Scalability]
- [Maintainability / Innovation]

What would you choose and why?
```

---

## Phase 2: Architecture Design

### High-Level Architecture

```
Design the architecture for [PROJECT]:

Requirements:
- [Functional requirement 1]
- [Functional requirement 2]

Non-functional:
- Expected users: [number]
- Performance needs: [requirements]
- Budget: [constraints]

Show me:
1. Component diagram
2. Data flow
3. Key technology choices
4. Potential bottlenecks
```

### Database Schema

```
Design the database schema for [PROJECT].

Core entities:
- [Entity 1]: [description]
- [Entity 2]: [description]

Relationships:
- [Entity 1] has many [Entity 2]
- [etc.]

Create the schema with:
- Primary keys
- Foreign keys
- Indexes for common queries
- Timestamps (created_at, updated_at)
```

---

## Phase 3: Project Setup

### Initialize Project

```
Set up a new [FRAMEWORK] project with:

Features needed:
- [Feature 1: e.g., TypeScript]
- [Feature 2: e.g., ESLint + Prettier]
- [Feature 3: e.g., Testing setup]

Project structure:
- [Any preferences]

Give me the commands and initial configuration files.
```

### Configure Development Environment

```
Set up the dev environment for this project:

Stack: [your stack]
OS: [your OS]

I need:
- Dev server with hot reload
- Debugging setup
- Environment variables
- Git hooks (pre-commit)
- Docker for local services (if needed)
```

### Create AGENTS.md

```
Create an AGENTS.md file for my project:

Project: [name]
Stack: [technologies]
Structure: [file organization]

Include:
- Project context
- Coding conventions
- Current sprint goals
- Important patterns
```

---

## Phase 4: Core Implementation

### Build Foundation

```
Let's build the foundation. Start with:

1. [Core module 1 - e.g., Database connection]
2. [Core module 2 - e.g., Authentication]
3. [Core module 3 - e.g., Base API structure]

Build them in order, showing me each one.
```

### First Feature

```
Build the first core feature: [FEATURE NAME]

User story: As a [user], I want to [action] so that [benefit]

Acceptance criteria:
- [ ] [Criterion 1]
- [ ] [Criterion 2]

Include:
- Backend implementation
- Frontend (if applicable)
- Basic tests
- Error handling
```

### Iterate and Refine

```
The basic [feature] works. Now improve it:

Current issues:
- [Issue 1]
- [Issue 2]

Enhancements:
- [Enhancement 1]
- [Enhancement 2]

Keep backward compatibility with what's already working.
```

---

## Phase 5: Quality & Polish

### Add Comprehensive Testing

```
Add tests for the current codebase:

Priority areas:
1. [Critical path 1]
2. [Critical path 2]

Test types needed:
- Unit tests for utilities
- Integration tests for API
- E2E test for main user flow

Use [testing framework].
```

### Error Handling & Edge Cases

```
Review the codebase for error handling:

Current state:
- [What exists]

Add:
- Graceful error handling
- User-friendly error messages
- Logging for debugging
- Recovery mechanisms where possible
```

### Documentation

```
Create documentation for the project:

1. README with setup instructions
2. API documentation
3. Contributing guide
4. Environment variables reference
```

---

## Phase 6: Deployment

### Deployment Setup

```
Set up deployment for [PLATFORM]:

Project: [type]
Target: [Vercel / AWS / Railway / etc.]

Need:
- CI/CD pipeline
- Environment configuration
- Database migration strategy
- Monitoring/logging setup
```

### Pre-Launch Checklist

```
Pre-launch checklist for my project:

Review:
- [ ] Security (auth, validation, secrets)
- [ ] Performance (queries, caching, assets)
- [ ] Error handling (logging, user messages)
- [ ] SEO (if applicable)
- [ ] Analytics
- [ ] Legal (privacy policy, terms)

Flag any issues.
```

## Workflow Summary

```
Day 1: Vision → Architecture → Setup
Day 2-3: Core features (iterate)
Day 4: Testing + Polish
Day 5: Deploy + Launch
```

The key is staying in flow. Don't overthink—ship something, then improve it.
